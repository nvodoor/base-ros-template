    A production-grade and high-quality navigation framework.
  </h2>

  It provides perception, planning, control, localization, visualization, and much more to build highly reliable autonomous systems. This will compute an environmental model from sensor and semantic data, dynamically path plan, compute velocities for motors, avoid obstacles, and structure higher-level robot behaviors.
